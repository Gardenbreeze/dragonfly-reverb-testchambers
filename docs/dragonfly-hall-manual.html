    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Dragonfly Hall Reverb is a stereo-to-stereo concert hall style
      reverb effect. It is based on Hibiki Reverb from Freeverb3VST,
      consisting of Moorer's early reflection model and a modified
      FDN allpass Zita reverb. Dragonfly Reverb is available as a
      64-bit plug-in for Windows, OS X and Linux. It is distributed
      under the GPL 3.0 License.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragonfly Reverb is primarily intended for use as a concert hall
      reverb. It also has numerous smaller presets like rooms,
      studios, and chambers, as well as several larger (and even
      enormous) presets. The presets have been adapted almost directly
      from Hibiki Reverb. The presets are divided into five
      categories: Rooms, Studios, Small Halls, Medium Halls and Large
      Halls. These represent “real spaces” ranging in size from small
      to large.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Dragonfly Hall Reverb is built on the same algorithms as
      Hibiki reverb, it has a very different user interface. To make
      the interface more simple, some parameters have been
      consolidated into single dials, and some parameters have been
      set to fixed values and are not exposed at all.
    </p>
    <h1>User Interface</h1>
    <h2>Sliders</h2>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-hall-reverb/sliders.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>Dry Level</dt><dd>Level of the input signal sent directly to the reverb’s output</dd>
      <dt>Early Level</dt><dd>Level of the early reflection signal in the reverb’s output</dd>
      <dt>Early Send</dt><dd>Level of the early reflection signal mixed into the input to the late reverberation algorithm</dd>
      <dt>Late Level</dt><dd>Level of the late reverberation signal in the reverb’s output</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The output of the Dry, Early, and Late controls are combined to
      form the reverb’s output signal. Note that sliders are not
      controlled by the presets. This allows you to set the levels in
      a way that works for you projects, and then explore different
      presets without the sliders changing.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic Dials</h2>
    <p>
      Note that holding the Shift key and clicking a dial will reset
      the dial to the default for the current preset.
    </p>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-hall-reverb/size-width-dials.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>Size</dt>
      <dd>
	Length of the reverb’s internal delay lines. Increasing the
	Size parameter generally leads to a smoother, less resonant
	output however it can also increase the reverb’s attack time
	and make individual early reflections more audible. Decreasing
	the Size parameter generally has the opposite effect,
	decreasing the reverb’s attack time and making individual
	early reflections less audible although it can increase the
	presence of metallic resonances.
      </dd>
      <dd>
	In physical terms, Dragonfly Reverb’s Size control corresponds
	to the largest dimension of an imaginary space. When the size
	is small, the “walls” of this space are closer together and
	the resultant reflection density increases. When the size is
	large, that reflection density decreases. It is recommended
	that for natural sounding reverbs the Size range be limited to
	around 24 meters to 45 meters. However, there are many useful
	reverbs that are outside this range.
      </dd>
      <dt>Width</dt>
      <dd>
	The Width control sets the stereo width of Dragonfly Reverb’s
	output. Note that the Width parameter applies to both the
	early reflections and the late reverberation. This is
	different to the Hibiki reverb which allows the user to
	control the early reflection width and late reverberation
	width independently.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-hall-reverb/predelay-decay-dials.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>Predelay</dt>
      <dd>
	Delay before the onset of the late reverberation. Note that
	only the late reverberation is delayed. Early reflections are
	always output immediately. You can see this by doing the
	following. After setting the reverb to 100% Early, and 0%
	Late, it can be seen that changing the Predelay doesn't move
	the early reflections shown on the spectrogram. However, with
	0% Dry and 100% Late, the late reverberation shown on the
	spectrogram is moved according to the setting of the Predelay.
      </dd>
      <dt>Decay</dt>
      <dd>
	Length of time for the late reverberation to decrease by 60dB.
      </dd>

    <h2>Preset Browser</h2>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-hall-reverb/presets.png" />
    <p>
      The Preset Browser section presents the user with a range of
      room, studio, and hall presets.
    </p>
    <h2>Spectrogram</h2>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-hall-reverb/spectrogram.png" />
    <p>
      The spectrogram has been included so that the user can get a
      better idea of how the various reverb paramters affect the
      plug-in’s output. The spectrogram is rendered by simulating a
      burst of white noise through the reverb algorithm with the
      current settings, and then processing the output with a fast
      fourier transform algorithm.

    <h2>Advanced Dials</h2>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-hall-reverb/modulation-dials.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>Diffuse</dt>
      <dd>
	Adjusts the coefficients of the allpass filters in the late
	reverberation algorithm. It enables the user to balance echo
	density against unpleasant colouration so that the result
	enhances rather than detracts from the audio input signal.
      </dd>
      <dd>
	A challenge that the designers of early digital reverbs faced
	was generating a realistic number of early reflections or echo
	density. One solution to this problem was to use allpass
	filter networks. Although successful in increasing echo
	density, the downside of allpass filter networks is that they
	have a tendency to resonate, particularly when the input
	signal is impulsive. This means that there is a tradeoff
	between echo density and colouration.
      </dd>
      <dd>
	In general, low echo density or diffusion settings increase
	the perception of discrete echoes. In the case of
	transient-rich sounds this can lead to “machine-gun-like”
	effects in which individual echoes are heard. For sustained
	sounds, this is less of an issue. Increasing the Diffusion
	setting makes individual echoes less perceptible and generally
	leads to a smoother, more lush reverb sound however it also
	can introduce metallic resonances which can be noticeable but
	depend to a large extent on the nature of the input signal.
      </dd>
      <dd>
	To better understand the effects of Dragonfly Reverb’s Diffuse
	control, open a track with clear percussive sounds. Decreasing
	the Diffuse value will result in fewer, more discrete
	reflections in the late reverberation. When set at very low
	values the late reverberation has an almost "shattering" sound
	to it. A higher Diffuse setting results in the late
	reverberation having a smoother and richer sound.
      </dd>
      <dt>Modulation</dt>
      <dd>
	Level of modulation on the late reverberation signal. If this
	is set to 0%, the following Spin and Wander dials will have no
	effect.
      </dd>
      <dt>Spin</dt>
      <dd>
	Rate of modulated chorus effect on the late reverberation. In
	most cases, values from 1–2 Hz are appropriate. Typically,
	these values should be smaller for small rooms and chambers,
	however it’s always best to set the parameters according to
	the musical context. Higher Spin values can lead to an audible
	“wobble” particularly in real instruments such as acoustic
	guitar or piano and can also cause noise on pure tones. This
	effect tends to be less noticeable on speech.
      </dd>
      <dt>Wander</dt>
      <dd>
	Length of modulated chorus effect on the late reverberation,
	measured in milliseconds.
      </dd>
      <dd>
	To better understand the effects of Spin and Wander, set a
	large room size, a long delay, Modulation to 100%, and Wander
	to 0 ms. Then play an abrupt sound such as a percussion hit or
	a chord on piano or guitar. You'll notice the reverb tail
	panning alternately left and right in the stereo field at the
	rate set by Spin control. There are multiple late
	reverberation layers, but they are all synchronised when
	Wander is set to 0 ms. Next, slightly increase the Wander
	setting. As you do this, you will find that the Spin
	"movement" of the layered late reverberation spreads out. The
	layers all still “spin” at the same rate, but at any given
	time each one has its own location in the stereo field.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-hall-reverb/high-dials.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>High Cut</dt>
      <dd>
	Cutoff frequency of the reverb’s low pass filter, applied to
	both the early reflections and late reverberation.
      </dd>
      <dt>High Cross</dt>
      <dd>
	Short for High Crossover, the threshold in Hz above which the
	High Multiplier parameter affects the high frequency component
	of the late reverberation.
      </dd>
      <dt>High Mult</dt>
      <dd>
	Short for High Multiplier. Multiplies the decay time of
	frequencies above the High Crossover frequency. Applies only
	to the late reverberation signal.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <img src="images/dragonfly-hall-reverb/low-dials.png" />
    <dl>
      <dt>Low Cut</dt>
      <dd>
	Cutoff frequency of the reverb’s high pass filter, is applied
	to both the early reflectinos and late reverberation.
      </dd>
      <dt>Low Cross</dt>
      <dd>
	Short for Low Crossover, the threshold below which the Low
	Multiplier parameter affects the low frequency component of
	the late reverberation.
      </dd>
      <dt>Low Mult</dt>
      <dd>
	Short for Low Multiplier. Multiplies the decay time below the
	Low Crossover frequency. Applies only to the late
	reverberation signal.
      </dd>
      <p>
	The Crossover and Multiplier parameters work together to
	determine the characteristics of the late reverberation. For
	example, with Decay is set to 2.0s, High Crossover set to 5
	kHz, and High Multiplier set to 0.8 X, frequencies above 5kHz
	will generally have a decay time of 2.0s x 0.8 = 1.6s. Note
	that the crossover frequency isn't a hard boundary, so the
	decay time will be ramped near the threshold. The same applies
	to the Low Crossover and Low Multiplier parameters. For
	example, with Decay set to 2.0s, Low Crossover set to 1 kHz
	and Low Multiplier set to 1.5, frequencies under 1 kHz will
	have a decay time of 2.0s x 1.5 = 3.0s.
